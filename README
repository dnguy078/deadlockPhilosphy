run:
	./run (number of philosphers)

A philopher can starve when there occurs a deadlock. A deadlock can occur in
this system when each philospher is holding her left chopstick and waiting for
the chopstick to her right. To fix this, we added bounded waiting time, a
philospher can only eat for a certain time amount until releasing the
chopsticks. To evenly distribute the disadvantages the yellow chopstick should
be place to her right and other chopstick to her left.
